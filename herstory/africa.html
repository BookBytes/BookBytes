        <p class="lead">From ancient Egyptian culture to that of Njinga's tribe of the ____ people to the matrilineal belt, Africa offers many different examples of societal organization styles. Across Africa premodern women regularly held rulership roles, often participated in the warrior cultures, and were actively involved in matters of economics and trade. With such a range of societies to look at across Africa, the continent is here represented by in-depth looks both at a series of powerful African women and at general information available on women's lives in certain tribes and societies.</p>

        <h4>Egypt</h4>
        <p>In ancient Egypt women had legal statuses and rights as well as the relatively common opportunity to run the family business. Lineage was also recorded via maternal and paternal lines, meaning that family history and legitimacy for rule were marked by both sides of the family; as such, Egyptians would often depict their mothers in their tomb carvings<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>Having a legal status came with full legal rights for Egyptian women. They could press claims against others; testify in court; be tried and charged for breaking the law; make wills; inherit, manage, and trade property; and serve as trustees and estate representatives<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. Writings left behind on pottery, known as ostraca, suggest that while women did indeed engage in court activities it was generally less often than men did<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. The records of women being tried for debt neglect indicates that women were independent owners and borrowers of wealth, like in early Korea. Contrast this with the assignment of one's wealth to a spouse and the loss of legal status that oft applied to women in much of later premodern China.</p>
        <p>Through property ownership women also wielded economic power. Women also held joint property with their spouses and inherented in part from their spouses' individual property, sometimes even being gifted the entire estate over any children<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. Women had free choice to dispense with their individual wealth. One 20th Dynasty woman, Lady Naunakhte, chose to essentially disinherent some of her children from receiving any of her personal property based on their treatment towards her in her older years<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. This element of choice is echoed across other wills and testaments from the time and reveals the economic power Egyptian women held both during and after their lives.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="mb-0">I am a free woman of Egypt. I have raised eight children, and have provided them with everything suitable to their station in life. But now I have grown old and behold, my children don't look after me any more. I will therefore give my goods to the ones who have taken care of me. I will not give anything to the ones who have neglected me.</p>

            <cite title="Source Title"><a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a></cite>
          </footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Education, Business and trade - As young girls Egyptian women were trained for domestic tasks alongside their mothers while boys would continue their schooling. This lack of formalized education can be more attributed to the cost than to an overt objection to female education<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. In spite of this general schooling deficit the diety of writing was Seshat, a goddess<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. This lends support to the situational reason over the idealistic reason. Royal women, such as Queen Hatchepsut's daughter Princess Neferure, were trained by private tutors<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. Numerous women did manage to educate themselves in basic reading and writing for household management purposes. Everyday writings left behind suggest that they took notes for similar uses as people do today: shopping lists and clothing design tips, including for undergarments<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. Women, especially of the upper classes, often had the opportunity to take over their husband's businesses when their husbands were away for travel, extended business, or war.</p>
        <p>Domestic and writing - Women had domestic roles beyond that of marriage. Some women were "administrators, musicians or maids"<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. They also were often responsible for the care of young relatives and other children in the family, even those that were not their own<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. Therefore, extended family was important to female familial relations.</p>
        <p>Finding a partner was a significant step into adulthood for young Egyptian girls. Marriage in ancient Egypt was an independent and often unofficial affair<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. Like in the premodern Korean tribes, registration of a marriage was merely a formality. Further, both the early Korean tribes and ancient Egypt occasionally discussed matters of menustration in writing with a factual tone, suggesting that the topic was not taboo. Marital status in early Egypt is not easily distinguishable in records because of the lack of a word for "wedding" as well as the absence of any traditional Western bridal items or surname changes<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. That is not to say that new co-habitation, the key marker of a partnership, was not celebrated. Concubines were also present in society. With partnerships fluid and chastity of low importance, women likely had a degree of sexual freedom outside of attachment. However within an official arrangement their agency was greatly limited. The punishment for female adultery was very severe, with the potential for death or facial mutilation<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. In contrast, men were only discouraged from affairs where the woman was married, because it would led to problems with the other husband<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. When something of this nature occurred the woman was usually blamed for initiating the contact with inappropriate flirtations<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a>. Therefore, even though women had the ability to mutually break a relationship and the element of choice of a partner, within the structure of marriage women were restricted.</p>
        <p>Famous women and stories</p>
        <p>Revered deities and stories</p>
        <p>The conjunction of legal and economic independence gave Egyptian women a great degree of agency. A moral wife could wield great power but once her morality was in question her position was threatened.</p>
