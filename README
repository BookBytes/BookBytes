Edit: Sorry I forgot to upload this in my initial completed website. This is the only thing I changed.

Name: Juliana Furgala

Completed: Everything is completed according to the spec. All three pages and a
css file for them are present.

Discussions: Received advice for how to center an image properly from Kenny Ling
             (my earlier attempts were sort of centered but weirdly skewed.

Hours taken: 2 hours to set up website, 5 hours for content, 4 hours for CSS
